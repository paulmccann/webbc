# Web dev 4 week Bootcamp

## intro

Understanding the web and the languages used to build it is critical for today's designer. Even if you never touch code again, knowing how typography, imagery, color and layout work on the medium of the screen will make you a better designer.

And without the skills necessary to design motion and interactivity, it's hard to even call yourself a designer for today's content.

As a copywriter, understanding the basics of interactivity means knowing micro copy can be as important as a headline.

As a designer, knowing how to design a micro reaction, can make or break the UX of an entire site or app.
